## [7.1.0] - 2019-04-11
### Added
- IP whitelist: Add a Comment field next to each IP address to help identify IP addresses added to the whitelist.
- Add constants to force enable/disable restrictions. Set `RSA_FORCE_RESTRICTION` to `true` to force restriction or `RSA_FORBID_RESTRICTION` to disable restriction. `RSA_FORCE_RESTRICTION` will override `RSA_FORBID_RESTRICTION` if both are set.
- Unit tests accross plugin. Note that when the `WP_TESTS_DOMAIN` constant is set, plugin redirects are disabled. Only set this constant when running the tests.
- Deploy plugin from GitHub to WordPress.org using GitHub Actions.
- Various GitHub community files.

### Fixed
- Disable individual site settings when network enforced mode is on to avoid confusion about why your settings are not being respected.
- Correctly load admin JS.
