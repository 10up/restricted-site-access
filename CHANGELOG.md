# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/).

* Feature: WP-CLI support! ðŸŽ‰
* Feature: Whitelist IPs via the `RSA_IP_WHITELIST` constant.

* Bug fix: Restrict "virtual pages" and allow them to be used as the unrestricted page, such as with BuddyPress.

* Bug fix: Avoid double slashes in asset URLs that can lead to 404 errors.

## [ 6.2.1 ] - 2018-05-21
* Bug fix: Don't redirect logged-in users viewing the site in a single site install.

## [ 6.2.0 ] - 2018-05-18

## [6.0.2] - 2018-01-29

* A bunch of visual refinements that conform better with WordPress 3.4 and newer (spacing, native "shake" effect on invalid entries just like the login form, etc.)
* A bunch of under the hood refinements (e.g. playing nicer with current screen Help API)

## [4.0] - 2011-07-16
* New restriction option - show restricted visitor a specified page; use with custom page templates for great for website teasers!
