Limit access to visitors who are logged in or allowed by IP addresses. Includes many options for handling blocked visitors.

== Description ==

Limit access your site to visitors who are logged in or accessing the site from a set of specified IP addresses. Send restricted visitors to the log in page, redirect them, or display a message or page. A great solution for Extranets, publicly hosted Intranets, or parallel development / staging sites.

Adds a number of new configuration options to the Reading settings panel as well as the Network Settings panel in multisite. From these panels you can:

1. Enable or disable site restriction
1. Change the restriction behavior: send to login, redirect, display a message, display a page
1. Add IP addresses to an unrestricted list, including ranges
1. Quickly add your current IP to the unrestricted list
1. Customize the redirect location, including an option to send them to the same requested path and set the HTTP status code for SEO friendliness
1. Define a simple message to show restricted visitors, or select a page to show them - great for "coming soon" teasers!

== Installation ==

1. Install easily with the WordPress plugin control panel or manually download the plugin and upload the extracted folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the plugin by going to the "Reading" menu (WP3.5+) or "Privacy" (earlier versions) under "Settings"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I change the restriction settings? =

Restricted Site Access settings are added to the Reading page, with WordPress’s built in site privacy options. (It was moved there from a separate Privacy settings page in 3.5.)

= It’s not working! My site is wide open! =

Most commonly, Restricted Site Access is not compatible with some page caching solutions. While the plugin hooks in as early as it can to check visitor permissions, its important to understand that some page caching plugins generate static output that prevents plugins like Restricted Site Access from ever checking individual visitors.

To the extent that sites blocked by this plugin should not need to concern themselves with high scale front end performance, we strongly recommend disabling any page caching solutions while restricting access to your site. Keep in mind that most page caching plugins do not cache the “logged in” experience, anyhow. Also note that the plugin *is* fully compatible with other caching layers, like the WordPress object cache.

= How do I allow access to specific pages or parts of my site? =

Developers can use the `restricted_site_access_is_restricted` filter to override normal restriction behavior. Note that restriction checks happen before WordPress executes any queries; it passes the query request from the global `$wp` variable so developers can investigate what the visitor is trying to load.

For instance, to unblock an RSS feed, place the following PHP code in the theme's functions.php file or in a simple plug-in:

`add_filter( 'restricted_site_access_is_restricted', 'my_rsa_feed_override’, 10, 2 );

function my_rsa_feed_override( $is_restricted, $wp ) {
	// check query variables to see if this is the feed
	if ( ! empty( $wp->query_vars['feed'] ) ) {
		$is_restricted = false;
	}
	return $is_restricted;
}`

= How secure is this plug-in? =

Visitors that are not logged in or allowed by IP address will not be able to browse your site (though be cautious of page caching plugin incompatibilities, mentioned above). Restricted Site Access does not block access to your, so direct links to files in your media and uploads folder (for instance) are not blocked. It is also important to remember that IP addresses can be spoofed. Because Restricted Site Access runs as a plug-in, it is subject to any other vulnerabilities present on your site.

Restricted Site Access is not meant to be a top secret data safe, but simply a reliable and convenient way to handle unwanted visitors.

= I received a warning about page caching. What does it mean? =

Page caching plugins often hook into WordPress to quickly serve the last cached output of a page before we can check to see if a visitor’s access should be restricted. Not all page caching plugins behave the same way, but several solutions - including external solutions we might not detect - can cause restricted pages to be publicly served regardless of your settings.

== Screenshots ==

1. Screenshot of settings panel with simple Restricted Site Access option (send to login page).
1. Screenshot of settings panel with restriction message option enabled
1. Plenty of inline help! Looks and behaves like native WordPress help.
